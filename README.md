# Student_Performance_Prediction

We will examine the "Student Performance in Exams" dataset in this kernel, produce a variety of cool visualisations to help us better understand the data, and develop a prediction model for math test scores.

Reading our data set into R and investigating its structure and summary is the first step. 1000 observations are made across 8 variables in the dataset. Scores in math, reading, and writing, demographic data (parents' education, gender, and race), and information on test preparation are some of the variables.



The summary() function gives us details about each variable, including its character or numerical data type and, if it's numerical, its measure of central tendency and spread. Additionally, it offers details on values that are missing.



Then, for a neater appearance, we rename our variables and start coding.
